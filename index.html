					<h1 > Learning, recently... </h1>
<p > I started the <a href = "http://craftinginterpreters.com/"> crafting interpreters </a> book yesterday. It takes you through writing a compiler+interpreter in first Java and then C. I'm going to be following the book with Typescript and Zig. </p>
<p > Wrote the implementation of a REPL and a Lexer yesterday that reads through the text and produces a Token stream: </p>

<h5 > Why am I doing this </h5>
<p > Firstly to just learn, this stuff is super intriguing and I wanna know what pipeline my javascript travels through before its executed on what they call bare metal. I've also been wanting to learn about memory management for a while now. Last time this lead me to Rust, which was probably the wrong choice for the job, considering it obsfucates memory management through complex borrow checker patterns, though I did learn a lot in working in rust and started appreciating type systems. Anyways, I'm hoping <a href = "http://craftinginterpreters.com/"> crafting interpreters </a> will help me learn the memory management stuff through using either C or Zig (whatever I end up using) </p>
<p > The other — I've realised I am very much interested in this domain (programming languages) of CS. Although I'm not interested in optimizations and speed and all of that stuff (mostly cause that stuff is better left to the CS majors) I think where my intersection — being a graphic designer and also having this interest in CS — will benefit me is visual programming languages. </p>
<p > When we think of Visual programming languages, we think scratch. The issue with most VPLs is that they are just a stylization over already existing Programming languages. Though what would a deterministic (or not) language look if the primitives were based on space and geometry. What would the Lexing -> AST -> Runtime chain look if syntax was based on interaction of lexemes in space. </p>
<h5 > Why (i think) people don't experiment with this </h5>
<p > Mostly because any programming language when being created is thought as text, so writing, testing, running and all the tooling an resources are made with this base assumption. Programs are files that are edited with text editors. </p>
<p > Node based programming again is a frontend that outputs the same. </p>
<p > Though we can have this sort of spatial programming if we have a graphical editor... and then diagnostics would be based on where objects are in space rather than textual syntax. </p>
<p > [ps the vocabulary is lacking above, will come back to edit and refine this post]<br></br>[TODO: add a WIP/Draft renderer for the feed] </p>

					<h1 > Latest rabbit hole (Zig) </h1>
<p > Yesterday I fell into a rabbit hole. I was going through <a href = "https://permacomputing.net/"> permacomputing </a> writings and there was a <a href = "https://permacomputing.net/programming_languages/"> section on programming </a> which linked to a <a href = "https://drewdevault.com/2020/01/04/Slow.html"> this blog </a> and Zig was second to Assembly in terms of Syscalls and size. If yousee the benchmarks: </p>
<p > <img src="https://images.are.na/eyJidWNrZXQiOiJhcmVuYV9pbWFnZXMiLCJrZXkiOiIzNDA3NjU0OC9vcmlnaW5hbF9mMTkwOWYyNmQ4NWNiMTMwYmNlOGYxYTYzNTIzZmEwNS5wbmciLCJlZGl0cyI6eyJyZXNpemUiOnsid2lkdGgiOjEyMDAsImhlaWdodCI6MTIwMCwiZml0IjoiaW5zaWRlIiwid2l0aG91dEVubGFyZ2VtZW50Ijp0cnVlfSwid2VicCI6eyJxdWFsaXR5Ijo3NX0sImpwZWciOnsicXVhbGl0eSI6NzV9LCJyb3RhdGUiOm51bGx9fQ==?bc=0" /> </p>
<p > Zig seems to have a very close mapping to Assembly, that means very little abstraction. But it seems (from a general scan of people writing and talking about it (blogs, youtube)) that it is a very enjoyable writing experience. Of course, it is a low level language, so that means you have to do manual memory allocation and such. I've always wanted to try making a project where I need to do manual memory allocation, just to learn about it so I was intrigued at this point. </p>
<p > Also the minimal abstraction thing reminded me of Devin from 100rabbits' talk: </p>

<p > I really appreciated the ethical orientation towards language design. Even the foundation that is run is non-profit and sustainable in the are.na way, i.e. seek to raise enough money only to sustain a practice and not to extract capital from it. And overall orientation towards corporation and authors own <a href = "https://andrewkelley.me/post/goodbye-twitter-reddit.html"> personal <strong > actions </strong> </a> mirroring this position. </p>

<p > I think I'm encouraged to learn this language -> so I can also learn about lower level computing protocols and paradigms. Not sure what the scope of this exploration will be, will know more once I start tinkering with the language to see how hard/easy it is. To start of I'm thinking of making either: </p>
<ol > <li > <p > A version of the static site generator that produces this website (currently written in javascript) </p> </li><li > <p > An api client for are.na<br></br>--> (and depending how that goes maybe writing another offline proxy server for are.na in Zig)<br></br>--> and if that works then a CLI client for using offline are.na data to make media pipes (querying and giving parameters for outputing files (can be piped with opencv, fffmpeg, pdf, etc to make media object for design)) </p> </li> </ol>
<p > Lets see... will keep the reader posted. </p>

					<h1 > Editor </h1>
<p > As some of you may know I have been working on an Editor. I won't go in depth to explain exactly what it is, but essentially its a code editor that outputs to an iframe, and the idea is to be able to make it modular and interoperable and be able to edit the editor itself as you work in it. </p>
<p > I've been struggling to figure out what to name it, but after careful consideration, I have decided to name it editor. </p>
<p > I think the non specificity of what kind of editor it is, is interesting. It can be a code editor, but it can also be a photo editor or a vector editor or a json editor or a pdf editor, etc etc. </p>
<p > Also thinking, as a designer I think it would be cool if we could have a basic engine kind of thing for graphics and then we could just design our own tools. For instance game (engines) design tools are just gui based programming that make it super easy to make a game. So what if we had software that were graphic engines in this sense and you tinker it to fit your needs project to project and have some barebones versions for getting started as well. </p>

					<p > Calendar systems are so intriguing and complicated. I've been researching these different systems with all these different variations and the crux of most of them have been: </p>
<ul > <li > <p > Using celestial bodies (Sun, Moon and Constellations) as markers of time </p> </li><li > <p > In order to anticipate and predict seasons for festivals and agriculture (festivals heavily linked to agriculture). </p> </li><li > <p > Reconciling the inconsistencies between orbitting of moon around earth and earth around sun. (Leap years and such) </p> </li> </ul>
<p > Its also really cool to see how advanced these time keeping technologies were so early on (2000 years ago they had an accurate estimate of earths orbit time down to seconds). </p>
<p > Anyways working on a publication + poster + (maybe an animation) with omama putting together all of these ideas. </p>
<p > <img src="https://images.are.na/eyJidWNrZXQiOiJhcmVuYV9pbWFnZXMiLCJrZXkiOiIzMzk4OTg5MC9vcmlnaW5hbF9kMjlkOWYwNWQ5ZjQyNjUxNDJlOWExYzdiMzI5M2I1Yi5wbmciLCJlZGl0cyI6eyJyZXNpemUiOnsid2lkdGgiOjEyMDAsImhlaWdodCI6MTIwMCwiZml0IjoiaW5zaWRlIiwid2l0aG91dEVubGFyZ2VtZW50Ijp0cnVlfSwid2VicCI6eyJxdWFsaXR5Ijo3NX0sImpwZWciOnsicXVhbGl0eSI6NzV9LCJyb3RhdGUiOm51bGx9fQ==?bc=0" /> </p>
<p > Report from the calendar reform committee set up in india in 1957 trying to study all the variations of calendars in use across the country and try to reconcile them for a calendar that can take into consideration all the festivals while also work with the gregorian calendar used for civic purposes. The report is quite interesting and written in a very approachable language. </p>
<p > From the shallow reading that I did, it seems they wanted to have the two calendars, gregorian for civic purposes and the vikram samvat for festivals and cultural purposes. They proposed a change for the gregorian callendar where all years would start on the same weekday making it "better for mankind" for instance see chapter: world calendar, </p>

<p > There is also a whole section on reconcilling different dating systems and making sense of different timekeeping technologies so they can be put on a linear scale for archaeological purposes. </p>
<p > Overall lost of interesting things to think about, especially interested in understanding how multiple viewpoints on timekeeping can coexist. Also just thinking of celestial bodies as a timekeepers is a reframing of time I hadn't thought of even when it's literally out there. </p>

<p > 2 things </p>
<ul > <li > <p > it is a mechanical-digital calculator </p> </li><li > <p > yes, mechanical and digital. Digital being all computation is binary, the values in the gears cannot be between 1 and 2 or 7 and 8 etc, it can only be 1 or 2. The discrete nature makes it digital. He talks about certainty mechanisms like using ball bearings and springs to make sure there are no middle values, etc. </p> </li> </ul>

					<h1 > Mechanical sliders </h1>
<p > I've been intrigued by gears and other forms of tangible mechanics and I'm hoping to start exploring these for my Independent study this semester. </p>
<p > Laser cutting at the Xfab studio is super cheap so I'm thinking just finding wooden scraps and cutting out various sizes of gears so I can modular-ly use them and make interchangeble mechanics that can be used with arduino/computer-vision/sound. </p>
<p > I did a first attempt at making a wooden slider today: </p>

<p > The gears are offset farther than ideal so the actual slider is very loose. Though this was the first time I used the laser cutters, so I'm quite happy I got something out of it. Now just gotta commit to this, iterate and build on top of this and see where it goes. </p>

					<p > Added Link styles to feed & added a no javascript checkbox! -> that changes size of the divs. </p>
<p > Its a trick where you can use checkbox :checked psuedoclass and use the sibling selector : ~ to select neighbouring elements and change their css. No js required :) </p>

<p > Wanted to do this as an exercise+practice in static site generation. Maybe even an opportunity to make a static site generator. </p>
<p > While making this, as you can see above on the right, I highlighted  comments all of which start with SECTION mark. Wondering about a Neovim shortcut which will jumpstart a regex search<br></br>: /SECTION:<br></br>Which will easily allow me to jump to a section in the file. Thinking of single file programs with essentially really good navigation. </p>

<p > The colors on the sliders are misleading because it isn't really reading the color, but the grayscale values, so in theory all of them can be grayscale and it would still work. </p>
<p > TODO: abrupt progression instead of smooth gradient. Gradients with stops and what not. </p>
<p > Questions:<br></br>Can I encode bezier animations in color? </p>
<p > Statement:<br></br>A print is a certain type of movement. </p>
