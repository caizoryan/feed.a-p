<ul > <li > <p > Some way to know when people visit this page. I don't want to do tracking of any kind, just some kind of acknowledgement or something that there is a presence in this space.

This should be easy to implement as all the images and videos are already block references. For here I could link another block that probably talks about how this feed works on are.na or smth </p> </li><li > <p > Also wanna do a recap of this year. Things from this feed, things not on this feed, general reflection of tying things up and where to go as the new year approaches. </p> </li><li > <p > A tangential blog for longer form writing and project tracking/ case study kind of thingies. Where there's evergreen notes and maybe tutorials, WIP thoughts, drafts, essays, etc. I think this feed has been a really nice space for me to put stuff on that motivates and even structures my making. I want to have such a journal for long form projects now. </p> </li><li > <p > also wanna implement something like this: <a href = "https://liqvidjs.org/"> liqvid.js </a> so I can have like tutorials, or showcase something or present something without actually making a video but writing it in sort of an essay but it turns into a video. I could probably narrate it and use the transcript... smth smth. </p> </li> </ul>

					<h1 > Folding Problems </h1>
<p > I've been working on this for a month. but essentially this was the problem: </p>
<p > <img src="https://images.are.na/eyJidWNrZXQiOiJhcmVuYV9pbWFnZXMiLCJrZXkiOiI0MTgzMTc1NS9vcmlnaW5hbF80ZmQ2MDgxNDIwMmYwYzIxYTg1ZDk1NjNmMTQ3OGVmMS5wbmciLCJlZGl0cyI6eyJyZXNpemUiOnsid2lkdGgiOjEyMDAsImhlaWdodCI6MTIwMCwiZml0IjoiaW5zaWRlIiwid2l0aG91dEVubGFyZ2VtZW50Ijp0cnVlfSwid2VicCI6eyJxdWFsaXR5Ijo3NX0sImpwZWciOnsicXVhbGl0eSI6NzV9LCJyb3RhdGUiOm51bGx9fQ==?bc=0" /><br></br>Given a fold line on a sheet of paper, find how the paper would fold. So calculate the vector coordinates for the shape after these two quads are folded. </p>
<p > It took me quite some time to figure this out. I had to go back to high school math, and re-learn all the stuff I slept through. Revised on how to find perpendicular lines, what the slope/gradient of a line is. The constructing triangles using perpendicular line, using triangles soh cah toa properties to calculate the reflected points, etc... </p>
<p > <img src="https://d2w9rnfcy7mm78.cloudfront.net/41831782/original_49d9cb46bb62247f2e2c401db229e8c1.gif?1765866708?bc=0" /> </p>
<p > After bunch and bunch of failed attempts I got something like this working. Even after getting this working I had to tweak some stuff because it wouldn't work for all directions and what not. </p>
<p > Then once I had this working for a single fold, I was like cool, let me try for two folds! </p>
<p > <video src=https://attachments.are.na/41831797/edd7b7ee953461f05c89d140285d8028.mp4?1765866815 controls loop></video>  </p>
<p > And that worked by just incrementally reflecting all the points past a fold and iterating through them... Eventually made it so I can edit foldlines and have multiples. </p>
<p > <video src=https://attachments.are.na/41831814/a1656b8381b87e8aca7ad155ed52874f.mp4?1765866907 controls loop></video>  </p>
<p > And then finally, given a printed surface with say some image or graphic on it, how would the graphic look folded up given the fold lines. This one was more tough than I thought and it still break sometimes if the angle of rotation is more than 180 degrees, which I need to figure out how to fix. But still it looks so awesome and feels gratifying! </p>
<p > <video src=https://attachments.are.na/41831815/f8f00108882556941c14588d533c5aed.mp4?1765866911 controls loop></video>  </p>
<p > I find this video the coolest.<br></br><video src=https://attachments.are.na/41831851/c5ef23de7b62dc6e53c18781496bd5e5.mp4?1765867140 controls loop></video> <br></br><video src=https://attachments.are.na/41831852/9b8de84601354badc73144a57ef9ed2d.mp4?1765867145 controls loop></video>  </p>
<p > Although its funny cause when I print it out and fabricate it... it just feels like... oh cool you printed on a long piece of paper and folded it up :) I shall figure out some use case for this now that I've implemented it :P </p>

<p > Added project pages, you can probably see this on the right here -> </p>
<p > There's also some new view options. There's a list option which will display only the first line of each block. And if you click it you can visit the block as a page. The block pages don't have any css as of yet but will add these soon. </p>
<p > Hopefully this will be useful if I wanna link specific posts... </p>
<p > Something I wanna add here is a way for people to let me know they were here :)<br></br>I don't wanna add tracking of any sort cuz that suckssss. But I wanna add like a hi - five emoji or smth where people can click it which would log a visit of some kind... </p>

					<h1 > Adding categories (more like projects) here! </h1>
<p > As you may or may not know, this feed runs on <a href = "https://are.na"> are.na </a>... another thing you may or may not know is that I have a self imposed constraint to have no javascript on this feed. So how do I add categories?<br></br>So they're going to be implemented as channels. I will connect blocks from the main channel into these category channels. So blocks can appear in multiple categories. And for the rendering of this there's two options. </p>
<p > The easiest way would be to just create pages for categories/tags/projects. So each channel would just turn into a file, and then on the main feed I can visit these pages. </p>
<p > The other... actually I'm just going to stick to the easiest way. I have too much other stuff to do :) </p>

					<h1 > Using instagram </h1>
<p > I've been off instagram for almost the past 3 years. And I'm extremely happy with that decision and it has brought nothing but joy to me. However I think I need to interact with it for professional reasons. </p>
<p > So I've been thinking of alternative ways I could use it. One approach was Amir mentioning how he would have a system to only check and update it on one day in a month. So all stuff would get posted then. That I thought was interesting. </p>
<p > The one I just thought of was maybe, all the content and posts point outside of instagram. So for instance all of them are screenshots of my feed.a-p.space or website sketches. Or links to other peoples websites, etc. The whole point would be that these would all point outside of instagram. A link in bio interface that could open like instagram feed view and have links mentioned in each of the posts for easy access, so it is easy to get out of instagram as you enter it instead of being trapped in it. </p>
<p > This is an idea for an experiment. Perhaps I'll try it out. </p>

<h3 > Overview </h3>
<p > Essentially the website is static site generated, same as jekyll or something. There is three parts to this process. HTML is written in input.html, the HTML in that file is embeded with javascript. Essentially this file is parsed and generates an output.js file that generates the index.html. </p>
<p > The syntax of input.html is as such: </p>
<xmp> 

<h1>%%+foo%%</h1>
<p>%%+bar%%</p>

<ul>
%% for (let i = 0; i &lt; 5; i++) { %%
  <li> Item no. %%+ i %% </li>
%% } %%
</ul>

</xmp>
<p > This will need an import file that will supply it the data (foo and bar), in this branch its called import.js and knowing what variables to import, compiling this will output a js file that looks something like: </p>
<xmp>// output.js
import fs from 'fs'
import {foo, bar} from './import.js'

let html = ""

html += `<h1>`
html += foo
html += `</h1>
<p>`

html += bar
html += `</p>
<ul>
`
for (let i = 0; i &lt; 5; i++) { 
  html += `<li> Item no. `
  html +=  i 
  html += `</li>`
} 

html += `</ul>`
fs.writeFileSync('./index.html', html);
</xmp>
<p > one thing to note here is compare the syntax for %%+foo%% vs %% for (let ... %% lines. The + in the %%+foo%% line marks that expression as variable to be added to html variable whereas not adding the + puts the expression as it is into the javascript file. If we added 'for (let i = 0 ...' to html like, 'html += for (let i = 0 ...', it would produce an error, hence the distinction is important. </p>
<p > Which will generate: </p>
<xmp><h1>hello world</h1>
<p>this is a sentence and everything</p>

<ul>
  <li> Item no. 0 </li>
  <li> Item no. 1 </li>
  <li> Item no. 2 </li>
  <li> Item no. 3 </li>
  <li> Item no. 4 </li>
</ul>
</xmp>
<p > This is essentially it. If you know javascript, you already know this </p>

<p > Playing around with static site generation. Here is a basic draft I made for a static site generator which basically compiles to a js file. </p>
<p > Trying out a programming paradigm where I try to think of the most simple raw solutions, like just putting js inside html, that makes a js file that accumalates a string and performs conditionals and for loops. The cool part is I don't have to implement any of that, I can leverage javascript as it is into this. So I get functions, loops, conditionals, all of it for free! </p>
<p > +-> Templating also allows to template over js code :) </p>
<p > Also trying to do more things with css rather than js... here is a toggle that changes grid size based on html attribute, the js code here only toggles the attribute, everything else is css... Thought this was cool :) </p>

<p > Today's challenge is to make a snake game using ncurses (c library that lets you work with the terminal). </p>
<p > So essentially you have a Col(x)Row space and a concept of windows. And then you draw to this virtual window and call refresh to draw on the screen. So yeah, will be using ncurses and try make a snake game in a day? maybe 2... Lets see. Will update here on the progress. </p>

<h3 > Url file loading </h3>
<p > Until now if you wanted to load a file in the editor, you used the loader-object. Where you would enter the file path and press enter. </p>
<p > I added url based file loading today. It would have been super easy if the editor had a base url. Currently I have multiple versions of the editor as files that I can open and run them through /fs-run/* endpoint. </p>
<p > Anyways, so if I want to run editor five I go to: (url)/fs-run/editor/five.json </p>
<p > for six: (url)/fs-run/editor/six.json </p>
<p > for canvas: (url)/fs-run/editor/canvas-editor.json </p>
<p > and so on. </p>
<p > Today I added:<br></br><img src="https://images.are.na/eyJidWNrZXQiOiJhcmVuYV9pbWFnZXMiLCJrZXkiOiIzNDk5MzcwMC9vcmlnaW5hbF8yNTZiOWVjODBhZTk3ZjcxY2EwNzA1OGQwZjIzY2Y2ZC5wbmciLCJlZGl0cyI6eyJyZXNpemUiOnsid2lkdGgiOjEyMDAsImhlaWdodCI6MTIwMCwiZml0IjoiaW5zaWRlIiwid2l0aG91dEVubGFyZ2VtZW50Ijp0cnVlfSwid2VicCI6eyJxdWFsaXR5Ijo3NX0sImpwZWciOnsicXVhbGl0eSI6NzV9LCJyb3RhdGUiOm51bGx9fQ==?bc=0" /> </p>

<h3 > Added an Autofocus </h3>
<p > Whenever an element gets active (either using mouse or arrow keys[h, j, k, l]) the editor gets its x, y, w, h and zooms in on that region. This is useful when using only keyboard and don't wanna switch to mouse, the view will automatically follow the cursor. And also works with mouse :) </p>

<h3 > Component write Component </h3>
<p > Just added a component that will run the code you give it and render it in the component itself. So a mini sandbox of sorts. Will be useful to make GUI widgets - inputs, renderers while working on things... </p>

<p > This will, should have access to both states... will run in editor runtime but will have access to iframe runtime through m() </p>

					<p > The feed is also a workshop. </p>
<p > If I port the feed to the editor, I can workshop blog pages. For instance I can start with combining feed posts, or writing one long feed post and exporting it as a webpage. And I can edit and refine the blocks on feed.a-p.space. Sanchari used a term called "soft-studio" I'm wondering if I can think of Feed as a "soft-studio". </p>

<p > Eg. Oh I really wanna be able to click this block to be active<br></br>which would be a note on me expecting -> (mouse and keyboard to work in coherence) </p>
<p > The thing come out of this would be 1. just an archive of ui/ux research kind of notes, but framed as my personal inclinations and how I incorporate them + 2.it would also be documentation for anyone else to learn and lastly the presentation of this documentation would be awesome to do in the editor, as -> editor views. </p>
<p > State -> which also includes the display (panzoom position included) + movement locked or something. </p>
<p > ^<br></br>|<br></br>_____ As files/websites. </p>
<p > Also I need to figure out bundling because that will show me how to export out webpages out of the editor (in the form of packages.) (resolve and push dependencies). This will also help me backend on are.na or something. </p>
<h2 > Other examples </h2>
<p > Autosave.<br></br>Some kind of confirmation when something is saved.<br></br>Need for feeling safe about your files, these past few weeks me working in the editor, it always feels so precarious. I also want to implement some sort of versioning because I am also scared of overwritting my files. So yeah, maybe another solution is using swp files and having a history of swp files. So its cache-versioing that you can just clear if you feel so or smth. </p>
<p > Git<br></br>I wonder if I could use git in a way where it tracks an entire folder, but since all my interactions with this folder happens through a node server, maybe each fs call can make a commit for any file change and then this commit can have a certain grammar, and I can query the commit tree for a single file's history that I can track. </p>

<p > I thinking looking into the architecture of theatre.js would be really nice because it seems to have very similar workflows as I have been working with the editor, namely these: </p>
<ul > <li > <p > Editor edits state </p> </li><li > <p > State can be used independently </p> </li><li > <p > making editors for state, and letting them interoperate </p> </li><li > <p > live edit data and see output </p> </li> </ul>
<p > While this is three.js specific I can use these qualities to just use in anything js essentially with the editor. </p>

<p > The whole idea that made me make this editor was having the editor be able to edit itself at multiple levels. Partly goes back to ideas in this video, titled: "programming should eat itself" </p>

<h3 > e-e-e </h3>
<p > An instance of editor runs and instance of editor that is running in an editor </p>
<p > <video src=https://attachments.are.na/34902883/b8ca703283b2d674ac713cb23b594020.mp4?1740817122 controls loop></video>  </p>
<h3 > Progression of editors </h3>
<p > Here's a quick overview of progression of editors, nothing comprehensive, just loading the files of each editor. </p>
<p > <video src=https://attachments.are.na/34902887/4918bb7f391b4368da9828069919c556.mp4?1740817193 controls loop></video>  </p>
<h3 > Editing syntax highlighting </h3>
<p > A video of changing css for the (2)editor's syntax highlighting, from (1)editor while (2)editor outputs parts of <a href = "https://conditionaldesign.org/manifesto/"> conditional design manifesto </a>. </p>
<p > <video src=https://attachments.are.na/34902911/21ab37a806a8e27575f5f5d3b197fba9.mp4?1740817508 controls loop></video>  </p>
<h3 > JSON viewer + code navigator </h3>
<p > A JSON viewer that renders the current code's navigation tree. The tsserver running for the editor responds a json blob with the whole navigation tree, and each item has a start position in it, the json viewer checks if a key is named 'start' and value is a number, and if it is, it will send a message to the editor to focus on the given position. </p>
<h5 > Here is the speedrun: </h5>
<p > <video src=https://attachments.are.na/34902932/a182a02ffb87568fd71aaf230ca9b2bc.mp4?1740817793 controls loop></video>  </p>
<h5 > Here is the final functional demo </h5>
<p > <video src=https://attachments.are.na/34903037/a80310392a9bad84782e64434c2532a2.mp4?1740818785 controls loop></video>  </p>
<p > Will be working on this further. Will make it embedded in the editor so it can be searchable and one can easily navigate to symbols in the editor. </p>
<p > Also need to implement a scroll to active block position for the canvas. Will also look into the canvas library I'm using I think it has a zoom to rectangle function, so could think of saving and navigating to rectangles and saving these. And then I can have a save and navigate to certain views. </p>
<p > Also Thinking about how the navigation tree can be used for metaprogramming for javascript/typescript. For instance you can query the editor for current tree. Have a matcher, say match the global scope Editor. Then for each of Editor's methods do something. And that can be outputed and added to script. Or it could also be used to templativize making a display component for a class. Like if you make a display component for Editor, you could have a live feed of its internals as the editor runs. And if you have templativizer, it could generate render methods and match statements and generate a function which you can manually fill in. Hopefully this is verbose enough to let me remember this idea. </p>

					<h1 > Lots of work on the Editor today </h1>
<h3 > Setting up TSSERVER </h3>
<p > The goal today was to get LSP/intellisense/autcomplete working. So I can get tooling over the code. Tsserver is a package maintained by microsoft that lets you create a virtual filesystem in the browser and get diagnostics, completions, linting, refernce trees and basically tooling over your code. I had seen this was possible before but it is a whole task to set this up. So I started by getting this tsserver connected to the editor. This took much longer than I would have wanted it to. </p>
<h3 > Reconciling blocks, character positioning </h3>
<p > The main issue with connecting the tsserver to the editor was reconciling the splitting of the file. The main function of the editor is to give you components that add up to the file. So a file is split up into smaller self contained chunks. This works all and good till the tsserver returns a {from, to} position for the diagnostics. </p>
<p > Each codemirror instance can work with from and to position only relative to its own state and has no way of knowing what had come before or after it. The way I fixed it was adding start property in each blocks state which the parent of the block manages. So everytime you save a file it increments and assigns a start value to each block. </p>
<p > There was also a whole thing about managing a live version of the file seperate than the file that is saved for iframe to update (can't update iframe at every key press, but need autcomplete response at each key press, so have to maintain two versions..) </p>
<h3 > Autocomplete + Linting/Diagnostics </h3>

<p > <img src="https://images.are.na/eyJidWNrZXQiOiJhcmVuYV9pbWFnZXMiLCJrZXkiOiIzNDUwMzM4OC9vcmlnaW5hbF85NjMxZDBlZGRhZDk0Mzk5MzNjYWMzMzBjYmRiMjdjZC5wbmciLCJlZGl0cyI6eyJyZXNpemUiOnsid2lkdGgiOjEyMDAsImhlaWdodCI6MTIwMCwiZml0IjoiaW5zaWRlIiwid2l0aG91dEVubGFyZ2VtZW50Ijp0cnVlfSwid2VicCI6eyJxdWFsaXR5Ijo3NX0sImpwZWciOnsicXVhbGl0eSI6NzV9LCJyb3RhdGUiOm51bGx9fQ==?bc=0" /> </p>
<p > So anyways got all of that working and here is a demo of getting a reference to functions defined in another block. And when you mistype it, or don't pass in expected value -> it shows you errors. </p>
<p > <video src=https://attachments.are.na/34503395/73f5ec08fa4c391455563544fe6cefc1.mp4?1739426755 controls loop></video>  </p>
<p > I did some writing in it and honestly its pretty helpful and works pretty well, feels quite robust, not as good as neovim obviously but pretty great for a web editor. </p>
<h3 > Editor Reference passing </h3>
<p > Finally, this is something I will work further on tomorrow... but a sneak peak: </p>
<p > <video src=https://attachments.are.na/34503079/58a90274a81d310b7ff23d05307a8121.mp4?1739425466 controls loop></video>  </p>
<p > I am able to pass the reference of Editor to the iframe, so the code running in the iframe is able to edit the editor. The below video will make it more clear, the editor outputs an iframe with buttons that onclick change the positioning of the editor. </p>
<p > <video src=https://attachments.are.na/34503077/4b84b6ea05b94190be9c570f20e2f772.mp4?1739425465 controls loop></video>  </p>
<h3 > File saves itself </h3>
<p > The next one is going to be, creating a file in the editor that will output an interface and have functionality that will read the editor's state and save the state to a file locally using the fs functionality implemented on the local server. So will be writing a js script that will save itself using itself. </p>

<p > The way I'm thinking is it would be a ui where I can see the screenshots (or can custom generate covers based on params) and those would be the branches of the code. Git branches sound very interesting in concept, but anytime I think of using them and consider merging and all of that stuff, I feel like its going to be not worth using because it will just escalate complexity and things are prone to go wrong. So if I could implement something based on git branches, I'll figure out how it works and then maybe I can use it... and maybe think of how I can engage in process differently using this branching sort of structure to iterate in different directions.... </p>
<p > Like there can be multiple ways of implementing something... and whatever seems promising you work on it in parallel. </p>

<p > I implemented saving and outputing html files and a mechanism to traverse levels. Just have to make it a little smoother to work. Right now its very jaggedy, mostly because I don't know how it should work. </p>
<p > The current implementation outputs the html file with a SOURCE_PATH variable which can be used to navigate back to the source files. I think this is the way to do it. </p>
<p > Also re-watched Nada Amin's <a href = "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SrKj4hYic5A"> Programming should eat itself </a> talk which I think got the cogs turning for me about metaprogramming. Though the talk mostly goes over my head. </p>

					<h1 > Learning, recently... </h1>
<p > I started the <a href = "http://craftinginterpreters.com/"> crafting interpreters </a> book yesterday. It takes you through writing a compiler+interpreter in first Java and then C. I'm going to be following the book with Typescript and Zig. </p>
<p > Wrote the implementation of a REPL and a Lexer yesterday that reads through the text and produces a Token stream: </p>
<p > <video src=https://attachments.are.na/34238991/a541feabc0f0f76705257df50cd8e57b.mp4?1738609992 controls loop></video>  </p>
<h5 > Why am I doing this </h5>
<p > Firstly to just learn, this stuff is super intriguing and I wanna know what pipeline my javascript travels through before its executed on what they call bare metal. I've also been wanting to learn about memory management for a while now. Last time this lead me to Rust, which was probably the wrong choice for the job, considering it obsfucates memory management through complex borrow checker patterns, though I did learn a lot in working in rust and started appreciating type systems. Anyways, I'm hoping <a href = "http://craftinginterpreters.com/"> crafting interpreters </a> will help me learn the memory management stuff through using either C or Zig (whatever I end up using) </p>
<p > The other — I've realised I am very much interested in this domain (programming languages) of CS. Although I'm not interested in optimizations and speed and all of that stuff (mostly cause that stuff is better left to the CS majors) I think where my intersection — being a graphic designer and also having this interest in CS — will benefit me is visual programming languages. </p>
<p > When we think of Visual programming languages, we think scratch. The issue with most VPLs is that they are just a stylization over already existing Programming languages. Though what would a deterministic (or not) language look if the primitives were based on space and geometry. What would the Lexing -> AST -> Runtime chain look if syntax was based on interaction of lexemes in space. </p>
<h5 > Why (i think) people don't experiment with this </h5>
<p > Mostly because any programming language when being created is thought as text, so writing, testing, running and all the tooling an resources are made with this base assumption. Programs are files that are edited with text editors. </p>
<p > Node based programming again is a frontend that outputs the same. </p>
<p > Though we can have this sort of spatial programming if we have a graphical editor... and then diagnostics would be based on where objects are in space rather than textual syntax. </p>
<p > [ps the vocabulary is lacking above, will come back to edit and refine this post]<br></br>[TODO: add a WIP/Draft renderer for the feed] </p>

					<h1 > Latest rabbit hole (Zig) </h1>
<p > Yesterday I fell into a rabbit hole. I was going through <a href = "https://permacomputing.net/"> permacomputing </a> writings and there was a <a href = "https://permacomputing.net/programming_languages/"> section on programming </a> which linked to a <a href = "https://drewdevault.com/2020/01/04/Slow.html"> this blog </a> and Zig was second to Assembly in terms of Syscalls and size. If yousee the benchmarks: </p>
<p > <img src="https://images.are.na/eyJidWNrZXQiOiJhcmVuYV9pbWFnZXMiLCJrZXkiOiIzNDA3NjU0OC9vcmlnaW5hbF9mMTkwOWYyNmQ4NWNiMTMwYmNlOGYxYTYzNTIzZmEwNS5wbmciLCJlZGl0cyI6eyJyZXNpemUiOnsid2lkdGgiOjEyMDAsImhlaWdodCI6MTIwMCwiZml0IjoiaW5zaWRlIiwid2l0aG91dEVubGFyZ2VtZW50Ijp0cnVlfSwid2VicCI6eyJxdWFsaXR5Ijo3NX0sImpwZWciOnsicXVhbGl0eSI6NzV9LCJyb3RhdGUiOm51bGx9fQ==?bc=0" /> </p>
<p > Zig seems to have a very close mapping to Assembly, that means very little abstraction. But it seems (from a general scan of people writing and talking about it (blogs, youtube)) that it is a very enjoyable writing experience. Of course, it is a low level language, so that means you have to do manual memory allocation and such. I've always wanted to try making a project where I need to do manual memory allocation, just to learn about it so I was intrigued at this point. </p>
<p > Also the minimal abstraction thing reminded me of Devin from 100rabbits' talk: </p>

<p > I really appreciated the ethical orientation towards language design. Even the foundation that is run is non-profit and sustainable in the are.na way, i.e. seek to raise enough money only to sustain a practice and not to extract capital from it. And overall orientation towards corporation and authors own <a href = "https://andrewkelley.me/post/goodbye-twitter-reddit.html"> personal <strong > actions </strong> </a> mirroring this position. </p>

<p > I think I'm encouraged to learn this language -> so I can also learn about lower level computing protocols and paradigms. Not sure what the scope of this exploration will be, will know more once I start tinkering with the language to see how hard/easy it is. To start of I'm thinking of making either: </p>
<ol > <li > <p > A version of the static site generator that produces this website (currently written in javascript) </p> </li><li > <p > An api client for are.na<br></br>--> (and depending how that goes maybe writing another offline proxy server for are.na in Zig)<br></br>--> and if that works then a CLI client for using offline are.na data to make media pipes (querying and giving parameters for outputing files (can be piped with opencv, fffmpeg, pdf, etc to make media object for design)) </p> </li> </ol>
<p > Lets see... will keep the reader posted. </p>

<p > As some of you may know I have been working on an Editor. I won't go in depth to explain exactly what it is, but essentially its a code editor that outputs to an iframe, and the idea is to be able to make it modular and interoperable and be able to edit the editor itself as you work in it. </p>
<p > I've been struggling to figure out what to name it, but after careful consideration, I have decided to name it editor. </p>
<p > I think the non specificity of what kind of editor it is, is interesting. It can be a code editor, but it can also be a photo editor or a vector editor or a json editor or a pdf editor, etc etc. </p>
<p > Also thinking, as a designer I think it would be cool if we could have a basic engine kind of thing for graphics and then we could just design our own tools. For instance game (engines) design tools are just gui based programming that make it super easy to make a game. So what if we had software that were graphic engines in this sense and you tinker it to fit your needs project to project and have some barebones versions for getting started as well. </p>

This is essentially what I'm thinking, but a little more barebones. Locally hostable, easily implementable, barebones that are more collection of concepts rather than a monolithic implementation.

<ul > <li > <p > Using celestial bodies (Sun, Moon and Constellations) as markers of time </p> </li><li > <p > In order to anticipate and predict seasons for festivals and agriculture (festivals heavily linked to agriculture). </p> </li><li > <p > Reconciling the inconsistencies between orbitting of moon around earth and earth around sun. (Leap years and such) </p> </li> </ul>
<p > Its also really cool to see how advanced these time keeping technologies were so early on (2000 years ago they had an accurate estimate of earths orbit time down to seconds). </p>
<p > Anyways working on a publication + poster + (maybe an animation) with omama putting together all of these ideas. </p>

<p > Report from the calendar reform committee set up in india in 1957 trying to study all the variations of calendars in use across the country and try to reconcile them for a calendar that can take into consideration all the festivals while also work with the gregorian calendar used for civic purposes. The report is quite interesting and written in a very approachable language. </p>
<p > From the shallow reading that I did, it seems they wanted to have the two calendars, gregorian for civic purposes and the vikram samvat for festivals and cultural purposes. They proposed a change for the gregorian callendar where all years would start on the same weekday making it "better for mankind" for instance see chapter: world calendar, </p>

<p > There is also a whole section on reconcilling different dating systems and making sense of different timekeeping technologies so they can be put on a linear scale for archaeological purposes. </p>
<p > Overall lost of interesting things to think about, especially interested in understanding how multiple viewpoints on timekeeping can coexist. Also just thinking of celestial bodies as a timekeepers is a reframing of time I hadn't thought of even when it's literally out there. </p>

<p > 2 things </p>
<ul > <li > <p > it is a mechanical-digital calculator </p> </li><li > <p > yes, mechanical and digital. Digital being all computation is binary, the values in the gears cannot be between 1 and 2 or 7 and 8 etc, it can only be 1 or 2. The discrete nature makes it digital. He talks about certainty mechanisms like using ball bearings and springs to make sure there are no middle values, etc. </p> </li> </ul>

					<h1 > Mechanical sliders </h1>
<p > I've been intrigued by gears and other forms of tangible mechanics and I'm hoping to start exploring these for my Independent study this semester. </p>
<p > Laser cutting at the Xfab studio is super cheap so I'm thinking just finding wooden scraps and cutting out various sizes of gears so I can modular-ly use them and make interchangeble mechanics that can be used with arduino/computer-vision/sound. </p>
<p > I did a first attempt at making a wooden slider today: </p>

<p > The gears are offset farther than ideal so the actual slider is very loose. Though this was the first time I used the laser cutters, so I'm quite happy I got something out of it. Now just gotta commit to this, iterate and build on top of this and see where it goes. </p>

<p > Its a trick where you can use checkbox :checked psuedoclass and use the sibling selector : ~ to select neighbouring elements and change their css. No js required :) </p>
