Lots of work on the Editor today\n\n### Setting up TSSERVER\nThe goal today was to get LSP/intellisense/autcomplete working. So I can get tooling over the code. Tsserver is a package maintained by microsoft that lets you create a virtual filesystem in the browser and get diagnostics, completions, linting, refernce trees and basically tooling over your code. I had seen this was possible before but it is a whole task to set this up. So I started by getting this tsserver connected to the editor. This took much longer than I would have wanted it to.\n\n### Reconciling blocks, character positioning\nThe main issue with connecting the tsserver to the editor was reconciling the splitting of the file. The main function of the editor is to give you components that add up to the file. So a file is split up into smaller self contained chunks. This works all and good till the tsserver returns a {from, to} position for the diagnostics. \n\nEach codemirror instance can work with from and to position only relative to its own state and has no way of knowing what had come before or after it. The way I fixed it was adding start property in each blocks state which the parent of the block manages.

So I can get tooling over the code. Tsserver is a package maintained by microsoft that lets you create a virtual filesystem in the browser and get diagnostics, completions, linting, refernce trees and basically tooling over your code. I had seen this was possible before but it is a whole task to set this up. So I started by getting this tsserver connected to the editor. This took much longer than I would have wanted it to.</p>\n\n<h3>Reconciling blocks, character positioning</h3>\n\n<p>The main issue with connecting the tsserver to the editor was reconciling the splitting of the file. The main function of the editor is to give you components that add up to the file. So a file is split up into smaller self contained chunks. This works all and good till the tsserver returns a {from, to} position for the diagnostics. </p>\n\n<p>Each codemirror instance can work with from and to position only relative to its own state and has no way of knowing what had come before or after it.

Will also look into the canvas library I'm using I think it has a zoom to rectangle function, so could think of saving and navigating to rectangles and saving these. And then I can have a save and navigate to certain views. \n\nAlso Thinking about how the navigation tree can be used for metaprogramming for javascript/typescript. For instance you can query the editor for current tree. Have a matcher, say match the global scope Editor. Then for each of Editor's methods do something. And that can be outputed and added to script. Or it could also be used to templativize making a display component for a class. Like if you make a display component for Editor, you could have a live feed of its internals as the editor runs. And if you have templativizer, it could generate render methods and match statements and generate a function which you can manually fill in. Hopefully this is verbose enough to let me remember this idea.","content_html":"<blockquote>\n<h2>drafting/inprogress</h2>\n</blockquote>\n\n<h1>(editor-editor) Updates</h1>\n\n<p>So I got the editor to <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\">work on a canvas</a> and its been fun using it since then.
