			<p > The feed is also a workshop. </p>
<p > If I port the feed to the editor, I can workshop blog pages. For instance I can start with combining feed posts, or writing one long feed post and exporting it as a webpage. And I can edit and refine the blocks on feed.a-p.space. Sanchari used a term called "soft-studio" I'm wondering if I can think of Feed as a "soft-studio". </p>
