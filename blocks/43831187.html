<p > I wanna turn this website into an RSS Feed. Essentially anything I want to publish would be here, including stuff over at writing.a-p.space and other stuff. </p>
<p > I will be posting on instagram, and I've mentioned some thoughts about that before over <a href = "https://www.are.na/block/41244256"> here </a>. But finally what I've finally come to decide is to post monthly, so first week of every month, a recap of the previous month. And instead of fitting media to Instagram constraints, I will be posting screenshots and screen-recordings from elsewhere on the web. As if to say, "If you want the full picture get out of Instagram, look at stuff outside the platform". I would obviously prefer not to engage with it at all, but I feel like I need some exposure for my work on that platform, and without which I may struggle to find work. But I'm not sure if this is true, but again I would rather err on the safer side. </p>
<p > Anyways. My primary posting would be here on the feed, and for those interested can subscribe to the RSS. </p></div>
