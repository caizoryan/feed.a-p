<p > <blockquote> Designed and coded</blockquote> </p>
<p > —A project I did, back in the blissful Fall of 2022. </p>
<p > An Archival Website of clips from an interview series that asked questions around, "Why do you love conversation?" </p>
<p > Naturally forming conversations around the topic that branch into various tangents and eventually drive back to the starting point. "Why do you love conversation?" </p>
<h3 > Structure </h3>
<p > Each interview is categorised into various interrelated topics through which the website can be organised, reorganised and viewed in multiple ways. </p>
<h3 > Process </h3>
<p > Each clip was printed, drawn on based on its categorization, scanned assembled into clips with audio and compiled into the archive. </p></div>
