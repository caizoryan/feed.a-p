<p > So generally things are going well. Currently the base of the whole reactive graph system is working well. And adding new nodes isn't as hard, although in the future will definitely be moving transformation functions and render into one file and export as an object type thing. </p>
<p > Anyways, so whats to do now... </p>
<ul > <li > <p > a list view for selecting which node to add, maybe like a command bar. Maybe can also use this to compose node trees, for instance perhaps I can type—<br></br>slider > *2 > {x} to make a slider thats connected to a multiplier node which exports as an x property. Instead of making 3 separate nodes and setting their values. So I get speed of typing code by the graphic qualities of canvas :) </p> </li><li > <p > Make connections selectable, some easy way to mass manipulate them also... change which side it connects and stuff. </p> </li><li > <p > I think its time to add deletability... delete nodes and edges </p> </li><li > <p > copy multiple nodes with their edges intact. So if for instance I copy a set of nodes, then it will also go through all edges and see if the edges are connections between one of the selected nodes (crucial to check that both from and to are selected) and if they are, copy those edges with whatever new id you give the nodes. </p> </li><li > <p > make a connection mode so can easily connect nodes, right now connecting nodes, you have to aim for the edge point (which also often interferes with draggin) and then connect to another edgepoint where you have to aim and stuff again, I wanna be able to just draw a line from one node to another and just connect that. </p> </li> </ul></div>
