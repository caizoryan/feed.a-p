<p > This is one way I'm thinking of setting it up. This may take place as a group looking thing. The group will be a node that outputs a function and can be referenced as a variable. The group will have inputPoint and an OutputPoint. The group will construct a function composition by traversing the nodes contained within it. </p>
<p > It will take the nodes that connect to inputPoint and follow them to each node that is connected to its ouput. While traversing, construct a transform function map. Once you make it to the output node, close the transform function map and export it as a function closure. </p>
<p > Some things to consider -> When does the function get recompiled ? (when any nodes inside emit a change... in a sense all of these nodes output to the group. Being in a group means to ouptut into it...) </p></div>
